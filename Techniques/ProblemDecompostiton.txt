üß© Problem Decomposition Prompting
A prompt which makes the LLM tackle each sub-problem individually.

üîç Least-to-most prompting:
LLM decomposes a large problem into various smaller problems to solve it sequentially.
Not suitable for every problem
"question" + first decompose the problem into separate sequential sub-problems. Then, iteratively solve each and use it to answer the next.
Can be used in junction with few-shot prompting
üìù Plan and solve prompting
First, the problem is understood, then a plan is formulated, and finally, the problem is solved step by step.
Has shown superior results than zero-shot prompting and, in some cases, few-shot prompting.
Structure: prompt + "Let's first understand the problem and devise a plan to solve it. Then, let's carry out the plan and solve the problem step by step."
